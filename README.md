**Main Assignments**

The tasks:

Interactive Typography: Produce interactive typography that responds to some input from the user, such as a mouse or keyboard interaction.

Unconventional Micro-Interaction: Microinteractions are small moments where the user and design interact, such as in the individual interface components. Choose a typical micro-interaction such as volume control, or colour selector, and create a playful reinterpretation.


**My projects:**

**Project1:** Typography shifting on x,y,z axis using the mouseX/mouseY-position. Utilizing WEBGL and lights to achieve zoom and 3D-effect.

**Project2:** Brightness value of image being reinterpreted into varying amounts of circles depending on mouseX.

**Project3:** Inconvenient date selector featuring hover-states, a randomizer and a reset.

**Project4:** Makeshift type editor controlled by sliders and clicks. The letters are editable, so are bg/text-color, a limited font-selection, strokeweight and textsize. Single click toggles the stroke-color between black/white, doubleclick makes the text follow your mouse, enter resets the canvas.
